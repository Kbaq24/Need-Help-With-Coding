I am trying to create a web-based firewall management and configuration game/tutorial using dynamic difficulty, hint and feedback system while using a story driven approach with VSCode. This is for a student innovation project so I am trying to do just 5 levels to keep it simple yet effective. I have uploaded the files to show what I currently have and need help. When I run it with the live server extension on VSCode, a black square shows up with a smaller green cube inside but nothing else. I am a begginer with coding and need help. Any assitance would be greatly appreciated.
